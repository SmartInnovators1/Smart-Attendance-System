# Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

## Project Overview

The **Attendance System Using Facial Recognition** is an automated solution designed to streamline attendance tracking in educational institutions and workplaces. By utilizing advanced facial recognition technology, this system captures and recognizes faces in real-time, allowing for efficient and accurate attendance logging.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Detects and identifies faces using a webcam.
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Records attendance with timestamps automatically.
- **User Registration**: Allows users to register their faces by capturing images.
- **Data Storage**: Attendance records are stored in a structured format (CSV files).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for users to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and capturing video from the webcam.
- **Face Recognition**: A library that simplifies the process of facial recognition.
